# PiggyShopUI [![Poggit-CI](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci.badge/DaPigGuy/PiggyShopUI/PiggyShopUI/master)](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/DaPigGuy/PiggyShopUI/~) 

PiggyShopUI is an open-sourced plugin using [libFormAPI](https://github.com/jojoe77777/FormAPI) to create form shops.

## Information
* We do not support any spoons. Anything to do with spoons (Issues or PRs) will be ignored.
* We are using the [libFormAPI](https://github.com/jojoe77777/FormAPI), so there is no need to install the FormAPI plugin.
    * In other words, you must use the pre-compiled phar from [Poggit-CI](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/DaPigGuy/PiggyShopUI/~) instead of GitHub.
    * If you wish to run it via source, check out [DEVirion](https://github.com/poggit/devirion).
* Check out our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ZZewRQH) for additional plugin support.
